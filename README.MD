## üß† The Philosophy

### The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, suggests that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Applied to learning iOS development:

- **20% of the Swift language and iOS frameworks** will enable you to build **80% of most common app functionalities**
- **20% of your learning time** focused on core concepts will yield **80% of your practical development skills**

### Why This Approach Works

Traditional approaches to learning iOS development often involve:
- Getting lost in documentation
- Learning features you rarely use
- Building unrealistic toy projects
- "Tutorial hell" without practical knowledge

Instead, this repository offers:
1. **Focus on the vital few** - Learn the 20% that matters most first
2. **Job-ready skills** - Prioritize what employers actually need
3. **Efficient learning path** - Clear progression from basics to advanced
4. **Project-based learning** - Apply knowledge immediately

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main phases:

```
ios_fundamentals/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.MD           <- You are here: Main overview and roadmap
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-one/          <- The vital 20%
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       <- Core Swift and iOS fundamentals
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-two/          <- The valuable 80%
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       <- Advanced iOS development concepts
```

### Phase One: The Vital 20%

Phase One covers the core fundamentals that will enable you to build functional iOS applications. This includes:

- Basic Swift syntax and language features
- UIKit or SwiftUI fundamentals
- App navigation and lifecycle
- Basic networking and persistence
- Common design patterns

**Time estimate:** 4-8 weeks for a beginner

### Phase Two: The Valuable 80%

Phase Two expands into advanced topics that take your iOS development skills to professional level:

- Advanced Swift features (generics, protocols, etc.)
- Complex UI, animations, and custom controls
- Advanced architectures (MVVM, Coordinator, etc.)
- Performance optimization
- Specialized frameworks (ARKit, CoreML, etc.)

**Time estimate:** 6-12 months ongoing learning
